Have you ever found yourself running into the same coding problems time and time again? Coding problems and projects are often very different but similar at the same time. While the content and objective can differ, the coding problems and issues that arise can typically be very similar. As such, I'm sure you might find yourself with issues you have previously come across. Or perhaps you have already realized a better way of doing things and have started using that new method when you come across the problem a second time. This kind of problem solving is the exact essence of design patterns. It’s, in a sense, knowing the solution to the problems before actually running into it, a sort of blueprint of how to solve these recurring problems.

To be more exact, design patterns, as outlined by the gang-of-four, have three different categories: Creational, Structural, and Behavioral Design patterns. Each of these categories have different design patterns within them such as the Factory or Singleton design pattern. All of these design patterns help to solve potential problems that could arise if you were not to use these design patterns. For example, the singleton design pattern ensures that there is only one instance of an object, providing a global access point to the instance to avoid potential overwriting of data which can lead to bugs. As you can see, these design patterns aren’t just solutions but a sort of preventative measure to ensure there are no problems.

Now, bringing design patterns back to myself and my coding. Have I used any of these coding design patterns? To be completely honest, after looking through all twenty-three design patterns, there are many that I have never even thought of using. I understand how to use it and how useful it can be but it has never come across as something that could potentially reduce future issues. Perhaps it is due to the simplicity of the programs I have written until now, but I have not even used the simple design patterns such as singleton. However, now that I have been introduced to these concepts, there’s no reason for me to not start using these design patterns. Perhaps they will not only improve my coding, but even my chances at an interview!
