## That Green Checkmark
I will be honest, as of now, my coding experience doesn’t go too far. I’ve done what the classes I’ve taken have required of me, but I haven’t branched out or gone much further that I could be. To be fair though, I am only about a year into starting coding, and I’m still not entirely sure if this is the path I want to pursue. 
There are a few factors that make me want to stay. I love problem solving and the rush you get when you solve a hard problem you’ve been working on. I’ve also started to realize the large number of different directions I could take this career into. This is especially true since society is becoming increasingly more reliant on technology and the possibilities just keep expanding.

## My interests
After taking some time to think, my current main interests in programming are leaned towards game design, machine learning and cryptography. I’ve loved video games since a child and still play from time to time. It would be a dream to work on a game I played as a child. As machine learning has recently started getting popular with the uses are growing, this is a path I am considering following. The thought of creating something that can “think” on its own sounds super fun and challenging. Finally, cryptography is not my biggest interest but after getting an intro during my ICS 241 course, understanding encryption, especially in a society where data security is so important, seems like an important skill to obtain.
