## Dipping the toes
As a complete beginner to the HTML and CSS scene, I quickly found that creating websites is not so easy… kinda. Creating a website with the simplest elements isn’t that much of a struggle as it's all within the barebone basics of HTML and CSS. In the introductory course I used, we made a website with photos, paragraphs, and even an input section! (hooray freeCodeCamp) Of course, applying these concepts in a new HTML file wasn’t all that difficult. The next part however, was much more different.

## The light!
When it comes to stylization, there are many different elements that we have to be aware of. Whether the photo is the right side, making sure it doesn’t repeat, margins … blah blah blah. The sheer amount of different little elements that had to be taken care of to make the website look good was overwhelming. And then there was light!

## Frameworks
UI Frameworks! Specifically Bootstrap was the framework I started using. It had files that you could load with built in support to make things easier. Creating a navbar was never so easy with UI Frameworks! Using UI Frameworks made my life much easier as I didn’t have to learn as much of the inner workings of every CSS style element. Now, after about a week of learning HTML and using Bootstrap 5, I have finally found a conclusion.

## Slow and steady wins the Race
UI frameworks were extremely helpful but at the end of the day, I still didn’t understand anything I was doing to style my website. I understood the basics and some more, but I found it extremely hard to create new styles and truly personalize elements. With this discovery, I believe the best answer, at least for me, is to learn CSS from the basics to a certain extent, and then move onto UI Frameworks. Rather than going straight for the finish line, I think it’d be best if I appreciate the scenery on the way. Well, in this case the scenery would be hours of learning CSS but I think you get the point.
