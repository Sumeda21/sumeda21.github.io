I will be honest, as of now, my coding experience doesn’t go too far. I’ve done what the classes I’ve taken have required of me, but I haven’t branched out or gone much further that I could be. To be fair though, I am only about a year into starting coding, and I’m still not entirely sure if this is the path I want to pursue. 
There are a few factors that make me want to stay. I love problem solving and the rush you get when you solve a hard problem you’ve been working on. I’ve also started to realize the large number of different directions I could take this career into. This is especially true since society is becoming increasingly more reliant on technology and the possibilities just keep expanding.
After taking some time to think, my current main interests in programming are leaned towards game design, machine learning and cryptography. I’ve loved video games since a child and still play from time to time. It would be a dream to work on a game I played as a child. As machine learning has recently started getting popular with the uses are growing, this is a path I am considering following. The thought of creating something that can “think” on its own sounds super fun and challenging. Finally, cryptography is not my biggest interest but after getting an intro during my ICS 241 course, understanding encryption, especially in a society where data security is so important, seems like an important skill to obtain.
In the future, I hope to take as many opportunities as possible which can help to build experience in anything computer science related. As I have said, while I am leaning toward game design, I am still looking to explore the various directions I can take programming into. As such, by trying different types of programming, I can find the area I find in which I excel and hopefully, find the most fun as well!


## In the context of programming

In the context of programming, this has always been true. The difficult problems have always been different, although changes in technology can change the landscape quite a bit. "Business" type applications are the things that come to mind for me. Those types of applications are usually coupled in some way with people ... and people are awfully hard to deal with!

Consider that one of the most popular content management systems is also considered the most horrible - Wordpress. But really, is there anything that fills that need? If it was so easy in the first place, where is the solution? Where's the magic CMS that is designed well enough that everyone hops on the boat to use it?

Some things are just difficult - building applications that humans use is hard, and will probably be hard for at least the near future.

## In the context of engineering

Ever hear people ragging on engineering companies for delivering late and way over budget? Well, some engineering jobs are really difficult, especially if the requirements and funding are undulating underneath you. Because of the nature of the problem, sometimes engineering firms require large amounts of engineers and workers, inviting further problems and delays.

The Honolulu Rail project at home has become this sort of poster child of failure, budget overrun and overall incompetence in Hawaii. Well, working though regulatory boards and fiscal procedures in Hawaii seems like it's a mind bogglingly difficult job to do. Granted, there might be some fishy stuff going on, but I refuse to believe that everyone is involved for nefarious reasons.

The problem of creating an unprecedented public transportation backbone on an island is difficult! I'm not sure we would have done it right, even if the best people were involved.

## In the context of relationships

So in the end, we realize that all engineering and programming is there for a reason - to serve human needs. Maybe that's why those things are difficult, because they both involve humans and are for humans.

Relationships, regardless if they're romantic or not take work. Humans are fickle creatures and relationships can come and go with the wind. To properly maintain something over time requires work. Family takes work. Marriage takes work. We live to figure out what works and what doesn't and hope that as we move forward we're improving.

Relationships have always been difficult, and by nature will continue to be so.

## Okay!

So back to the original premise; why is being one of the club officers so difficult?

And the final answer - it's supposed to be difficult, and it's supposed to challenge you, just like everything else that humans do that is difficult: programming, engineering, engaging in relationships, pondering the universe, etc.

Ultimately the question you should really ask yourself if something if particularly difficult is then "is it worth it"? That is something that is context specific and only you can answer yourself.
