# I. Introdution
In the past few years, AI has found its way into popularity through many different ways. Whether it is the camera filters in social media or the helpful AI chatbot that many websites are using, AI is starting to be used everywhere and Education is no exception to this. Whether for good or bad, AI has found its way into education via generative AI such as ChatGPT which can write essays and even code for you. For myself, I’m not much informed about all the different AI’s, but I have used ChatGPT on occasion to assist in creating code. As such, through this essay, I try to analyze my usage of AI and usage of AI within education.

# II. Personal Experience With AI
As I mentioned earlier, I haven’t extensively used ChatGPT and only used it for certain purposes. The main uses I found ChatGPT useful for was explaining code, quality assurance, and coding examples. While I have tested if ChatGPT is capable of writing full code for me, I decided not to use it as it really takes away from the learning process of coding. 

Now, to elaborate on my usage of AI, I typically used ChatGPT when I was met with code I received little instruction about. If I don’t know what I am looking at, how can I even try to understand it? As such, I would typically ask ChatGPT questions like, “What does this code mean : (code here)”. Similarly, I would sometimes come across concepts I wasn’t entirely sure how to use/wasn’t aware of all of their functions. In these cases, being able to ask ChatGPT for examples proved to be extremely useful. 

Finally, when I wasn’t sure why I was getting an error, I used ChatGPT’s help with troubleshooting. While searching and sifting through numerous articles to find the solution to my error was always possible, I felt like I could skip the arduous process of mindless searching and skip straight to the solution. Of course, I always tried to understand the solution and why it worked. Although this usage of AI might be a bit controversial, It definitely saved me a lot of time, and while I may have learned more by manually finding answers, I felt that using AI made coding a lot more enjoyable.
