This simple ASCII slot machine was the very first project, that was not required by the class, that I had written in my coding career. During a recitation for my ICS 111 class, our TA showed us a slot machine created with ASCII symbols and simple codes. Although he didn't show us the source code, I was immediately interested and wanted to make it myself. To do this, I created the ASCII slot machine which took quite a long time, and coded its using while loops and if statements. I created my own way of manipulating the odds of each slot symbol which was also a quite interesting thing to do. 

From the development and completion of this project, there were many things I learned. Not only did I learn how to create cool stuff with ASCII symbols, but I also learned more about myself and my ambition in regards to coding. This was quite early in my coding career when I was only writing code for the sake of assignments, so writing my own successful program which actually produces a fun result was extremely satisfying. Through this project, I was able to learn code AND gain some independence from coding just for my classes.

The code I wrote for the ASCII slot machine:

```
         System.out.println("=====================");                         //Print statement to draw slots with the symbols
         System.out.println("|-------------------|  O");
         System.out.println("|--  SHILL SLOTS  --|  |");
         System.out.println("|-------------------|  |");
         System.out.println("| " + one + " || " + two + " || " + three +" |   |" );
         System.out.println("|===================|--|");
         System.out.println("|===================|");
         System.out.println("|=====|       |=====|");
         System.out.println("|=====|       |=====|"); 
         System.out.println("=====================\n");
```
