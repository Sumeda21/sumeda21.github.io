This project is a program which can solve sudoku problems using bitsets. While a decent portion of this code was actually written by the professor, the main part of the code which contains the problem solving was written by me. This project, while not being extremely difficult, had a few advanced concepts such as back tracking with rucursion. The main stuggle I had while writing this code was understanding how the recursion takes place and how to write code revolving that, without any bugs.

Through this project I was able to learn about recursive back tracking and bitsets. Furthermore, while the professor wrote a good amount of code, I read over each method to understand what had been written. The code I wrote was the fillSudoku and fillSudokuAt method which, as previously mentioned, used bitsets to solve the sudoku problem. Overall, althouhg it is not such a complicated task, it shows a great  development from my very first program in terms of complexity and conceptual understandings.
