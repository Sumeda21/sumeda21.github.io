  This simple slot ASCII slot machine was the very first project, that was not an required assignment, that I had written in my coding career. I wrote this program after a TA showed me the running program and I decided to recreate the program with my own tweaks. While this isn't exactly a huge project, it was extremely fun to write and acted as a gateway to my code learning experience. 

  From the development and completion of this assignment, there were many things I learned. I learned how to use methods as well as how to create a loop which doesn't execute infinitely. I also learned what ASCII symbols were as well as how to use them to create ASCII "art". When looking over this code almost a year later, I can definitely see ways to improve my code, which make this project that much more meaningful. While it is a functioning program, I saw that there are always ways to optimize it, an important lesson for computer science.

The code I wrote for an ASCII slot machine:

```cpp
 System.out.println("=====================");                         //Print statement to draw slots with the symbols
         System.out.println("|-------------------|  O");
         System.out.println("|--  SHILL SLOTS  --|  |");
         System.out.println("|-------------------|  |");
         System.out.println("| " + one + " || " + two + " || " + three +" |   |" );
         System.out.println("|===================|--|");
         System.out.println("|===================|");
         System.out.println("|=====|       |=====|");
         System.out.println("|=====|       |=====|"); 
         System.out.println("=====================\n");
```
